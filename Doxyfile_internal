# The OUTPUT_DIRECTORY tag is used to specify the (relative or absolute) path
# into which the generated documentation will be written. If a relative path is
# entered, it will be relative to the location where doxygen was started. If
# left blank the current directory will be used.

# If the EXTRACT_PRIVATE tag is set to YES all private members of a class will
# be included in the documentation.

# \internal command is included. If the tag is set to NO then the documentation
# will be excluded. Set it to YES to include the internal documentation.
# The default value is: NO.

# If the SOURCE_BROWSER tag is set to YES then a list of source files will be

# The default value is: NO.

# Setting the STRIP_CODE_COMMENTS tag to YES will instruct doxygen to hide any
# special comment blocks from generated source code fragments. Normal C, C++ and
# Fortran comments will always remain visible.
# The default value is: YES.

# If the REFERENCED_BY_RELATION tag is set to YES then for each documented
# function all documented functions referencing it will be listed.
