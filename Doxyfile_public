# The OUTPUT_DIRECTORY tag is used to specify the (relative or absolute) path
# into which the generated documentation will be written. If a relative path is
# entered, it will be relative to the location where doxygen was started. If
# left blank the current directory will be used.

OUTPUT_DIRECTORY       = doc/public2

# If the HIDE_UNDOC_MEMBERS tag is set to YES, doxygen will hide all
# undocumented members inside documented classes or files. If set to NO these
# members will be included in the various overviews, but no documentation
# section is generated. This option has no effect if EXTRACT_ALL is enabled.
# The default value is: NO.

HIDE_UNDOC_MEMBERS     = YES

# If the HIDE_UNDOC_CLASSES tag is set to YES, doxygen will hide all
# undocumented classes that are normally visible in the class hierarchy. If set
# to NO these classes will be included in the various overviews. This option has
# no effect if EXTRACT_ALL is enabled.
# The default value is: NO.

HIDE_UNDOC_CLASSES     = YES

# The MAX_INITIALIZER_LINES tag determines the maximum number of lines that the
# initial value of a variable or macro / define can have for it to appear in the
# documentation. If the initializer consists of more lines than specified here
# it will be hidden. Use a value of 0 to hide initializers completely. The
# appearance of the value of individual variables and macros / defines can be
# controlled using \showinitializer or \hideinitializer command in the
# documentation regardless of this setting.
# Minimum value: 0, maximum value: 10000, default value: 30.

MAX_INITIALIZER_LINES  = 0

# Set the SHOW_USED_FILES tag to NO to disable the list of files generated at
# the bottom of the documentation of classes and structs. If set to YES the list
# will mention the files that were used to generate the documentation.
# The default value is: YES.

SHOW_USED_FILES        = NO

# Set the SHOW_FILES tag to NO to disable the generation of the Files page. This
# will remove the Files entry from the Quick Index and from the Folder Tree View
# (if specified).
# The default value is: YES.

SHOW_FILES             = NO

# Setting the STRIP_CODE_COMMENTS tag to YES will instruct doxygen to hide any
# special comment blocks from generated source code fragments. Normal C, C++ and
# Fortran comments will always remain visible.
# The default value is: YES.

STRIP_CODE_COMMENTS    = NO

# If the VERBATIM_HEADERS tag is set the YES then doxygen will generate a
# verbatim copy of the header file for each class for which an include is
# specified. Set to NO to disable this.
# See also: Section \class.
# The default value is: YES.

VERBATIM_HEADERS       = NO

# The PREDEFINED tag can be used to specify one or more macro names that are
# defined before the preprocessor is started (similar to the -D option of e.g.
# gcc). The argument of the tag is a list of macros of the form: name or
# name=definition (no spaces). If the definition and the "=" are omitted, "=1"
# is assumed. To prevent a macro definition from being undefined via #undef or
# recursively expanded use the := operator instead of the = operator.
# This tag requires that the tag ENABLE_PREPROCESSING is set to YES.
